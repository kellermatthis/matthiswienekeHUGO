A big thank you goes to the creators of [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/), who have made it possible to easily and quickly create your own blog, which is also a CV.

I'm unlikely to use the blog. I just needed a nice little frontend for my mainly used mail server and wanted to try HUGO.
